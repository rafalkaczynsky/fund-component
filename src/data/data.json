Instead of focusing on the same limited number of FTSE 100 giants that dominate so many equity income portfolios, manager Siddarth Chand Lall identifies the strongest opportunities across the market cap spectrum.</p>\r\n<p>While he does hold FTSE 100 stocks, he has a bias to faster-growing small and mid-cap dividend-paying companies in the FTSE 250, AIM, FTSE SmallCap and FTSE Fledgling indices. This increases the number of opportunities from around 90 stocks to approximately 700.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of multi-cap strategy</strong></p>\r\n<p>As well as benefiting from the superior long-term growth potential of smaller companies, this multi-cap strategy allows the construction of a portfolio far more broadly diversified by industry sector and market capitalisation than is possible for a fund focused primarily on the main divided-paying companies in the FTSE 100.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Growing dividends</strong></p>\r\n<p>The manager looks for companies with strong cashflow and little or no debt that are able reinvest in the growth of their business and simultaneously pay an attractive and increasing dividend. This dividend growth is an important consideration for investors looking to protect or increase their income in real terms.</p>\r\n<p>To manage stock-specific risk, diversification is key. The portfolio is spread across around 130 holdings, with even the largest position only representing 2%-2.5% of the fund.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The manager works with the support of a large and experienced team. They place a high value on the quality of management of the companies they are considering for investment. Wherever possible they will meet the management face to face before investing and once they have taken a position, they will meet them at least twice a year to follow up on results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Warning:&nbsp;</strong>The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you originally invested. The Fund invests in smaller companies which carry a higher degree of risk than larger companies. The shares of smaller companies may be less liquid and their performance more volatile over shorter time periods. The Fund invests mainly in the UK. Therefore it may be more vulnerable to market sentiment in that country. To ensure that the principal objective of providing an above average and subsequently increasing level of income can be met, the annual Manager's charge is deducted from capital rather than income. Future capital growth may be constrained as a result.</p>",

Investments in fixed interest securities are subject to market and credit risk and will be impacted by interest rates. Investments in higher yielding bonds issued by borrowers with lower credit ratings may result in a higher risk of default and have a negative impact on income and capital value. The Fund may use derivatives to protect the value of the Fund's assets or to reduce the costs of investing, although this may not be achieved. It is not anticipated that the use of derivatives will have any significant effect on the risk profile of the Fund. To ensure that the principal objective of providing a high level of income can be met, 50% of the annual Manager's charge is deducted from capital rather than income. Future capital growth may be constrained as a result.</p>",

There is a preference for organic rather than acquisition-led growth and a particular focus on quality of earnings, which should enable the company to grow throughout the business cycle.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Unconstrained approach</strong></p>\r\n<p>Richard is free of the constraint of benchmarks that might require him to have specified weightings to particular UK stock market indices. Instead he is able to make investment decisions based purely on what he judges to be the growth potential of a company.</p>\r\n<p>He manages risk by holding a portfolio diversified by investment theme, sector, style, currency of earnings and market capitalisation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Warning:&nbsp;</strong>The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you originally invested.

From this list he constructs a portfolio of around 100 stocks.</p>\r\n<p>When selecting stocks, David believes the quality of those managing the business is a key factor in the performance of large and small companies alike. He will aim to meet the management at each of the businesses on his focus list at least once a year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Warning:&nbsp;</strong>The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you originally invested. Changes in exchange rates may cause the value of the fund to rise or fall. The Fund may use derivatives to protect the value of the Fund's assets or to reduce the costs of investing, although this may not be achieved. It is not anticipated that the use of derivatives will have any significant effect on the risk profile of the Fund. The Fund invests in smaller companies which carry a higher degree of risk than larger companies. The shares of smaller companies may be less liquid and their performance more volatile over shorter time periods.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The emphasis is on delivering superior risk-adjusted returns.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lead manager Gurjit Soggi and the team hold a portfolio of between 20-35 holdings, which include actively managed funds and, where the team believes them more suitable, passive vehicles such as exchanged traded funds (ETFs).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They take a pragmatic approach that combines top-down analysis with bottom-up fund selection.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Using market profiles for the major geographic regions, the team will then use their own macroeconomic research, the position in the economic cycle and valuation considerations to determine whether they tilt the portfolio in favour of large, mid or small cap stocks. The same research is used to decide on a value or growth bias for the portfolio.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The team seek to populate the fund with a core selection of well-resourced managers with consistently strong performance. They aim to achieve a competitive advantage by selecting different manager styles to take full advantage of prevailing market conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, they will identify shorter-term tactical ideas or themes as &lsquo;satellite&rsquo; positions around the core. These may include energy and commodity plays, currency themes or positions in particular industrial sectors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Between them the team have more than 60 years&rsquo; experience of the fund of funds sector and place a high importance on their collective approach. They also have access to the expertise of the managers of Marlborough funds operating in a range of specialist fields, including bonds, Far East equities, UK equities, European equities and US equities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Risk Warning:&nbsp;</strong>The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you originally invested.
